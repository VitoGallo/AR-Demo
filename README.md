Welcome to AR-Demo, the iOS application that revolutionizes the way we interact with our surroundings using augmented reality (AR). With AR-Demo, you can transform your living space by placing extraordinary 3D models and enjoy an immersive experience like never before.

## Key Features

### ðŸŒˆ Immersive Augmented Reality
Transform your environment by seamlessly placing 3D models within your real-world space. Watch as these objects come to life, creating a captivating and immersive experience.

### ðŸš€ Model Selection
Discover an extensive collection of 3D models directly from the [Apple AR Quick Look Gallery](https://developer.apple.com/arkit/gallery/). Personalize your space with an array of furniture, fantastical creatures, and more, tailoring your augmented reality to your unique style.

### ðŸŽ‰ Interactive Animations
Have fun with interactive animations. Take control of their behavior using sleek glass-style buttons, adding an extra layer of interactivity to your AR experience with a simple tap.

### ðŸ“¸ Capture and Save Photos
Capture and preserve special moments within your AR environment by taking photos of the scene. Save these creative snapshots to relive and share your augmented reality creations with friends.

### ðŸŽ¯ FocusEntity Package
To elevate the immersive experience in AR-Demo, we leverage the powerful [FocusEntity](https://github.com/maxxfrazer/FocusEntity) package by MaxxFrazer. FocusEntity introduces a dynamic visual indicator that adjusts based on the detection of a supporting surface for 3D models. This visual element provides intuitive guidance, adapting to the conditions of the AR environment.
